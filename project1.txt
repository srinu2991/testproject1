Hi,
git project
checking git pull command
fetch is get the changes from remote to local without merging in local repo 
git head is a light weight pointer pointing to a recent commit in a branch
git branch -- if we want to add some new features then we will create a branch then add new features 
git checkout -b <branch name> this will create new branch and swith to that latest branch
git checkout <branch name> will switch to one branch to another branch
